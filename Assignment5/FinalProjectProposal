Final Project Proposal : Adding diseased cells (red colour)

- There will be a switch to let the user decide if they want this feature or not. (Flicking the switch on will randomly select one cell in every 50 to be diseased. Flicking the switch off will make all diseased cells regular living cells)
- Upon step, the living cells that are neighbours of the diseased cell also become diseased, and so the disease spreads.
- When counting living neighbours, diseased cells are considered living.
- Diseased cells remain diseased for the remainder of the run, unless the user decides to toggle it, in which case it becomes a living cell. Toggling it again will not make it diseased again, but empty. Basically, it become a regular cell upon toggle.
